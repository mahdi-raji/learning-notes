## Definition
Imagine someone asks you for the address of a guitar shop.  
Instead of giving step-by-step directions, you tell them:  
“Find the shop where guitars are sold on 15th Street near the _Foo_ market.”
(checkout [Imperative Programming](./Imperative%20Programming.md))

You are telling that person **what you want** — that is, to find the guitar shop near the _Foo_ market — without specifying the exact steps or _how_ they should get there.
