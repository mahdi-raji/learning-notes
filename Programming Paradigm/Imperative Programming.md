## Definition
Imagine someone asks you for the address of a guitar shop.  
You might tell them:
“Go straight until 15th Street, then turn left. Keep going until you see a market called _Foo_ — the guitar shop you’re looking for is right next to it.”  
(I’m bad at examples, sorry. checkout [Declarative Programming](./Declarative%20Programming.md)

You are telling that person **the specific steps** they need to take to get to the guitar shop, and _how_ they should get there.
