# 🧠 Learning Notes

This repository contains personal learning notes, diagrams, and summaries on various technical topics I explore during my development journey. The notes are primarily structured and maintained using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in markdown format.

## 📂 Structure

The vault is organized into the following types of content:

- **📘 Notes**: Written explanations, research, and summaries on topics like software architecture, design patterns, clean code principles, database modeling, and more.
- **📊 Diagrams**: Visual representations such as EER diagrams, UML class diagrams, flowcharts, and system designs using Excalidraw.
- **🧪 Experiments**: Trial ideas, thoughts, and problem-solving breakdowns for projects I’m currently working on.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**: A powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of Markdown files.
- **Markdown**: For clean and portable text-based note-taking.
- **GitHub**: To version control and share the notes publicly.

## 📌 How to Use

### Clone the Repository 
   Download the project to your local machine:  
   `git clone https://github.com/mehdi-raji/learning-notes.git`
   
### Open with Obsidian

1. Launch **Obsidian**.
2. Select **“Open Folder as Vault”** and choose the cloned folder.

> **Tip:** All my themes and plugins are inside the `.My.ObsidianFile` folder.  
> If you replace Obsidian’s default `.obsidian` folder with `.My.ObsidianFile`, you will have all my themes and plugins configured exactly as in my setup.

## 🧭 Goals

This vault serves multiple purposes:

- Deepen understanding of complex concepts through structured note-taking.
- Document progress in learning architecture and real-world project planning.
- Build a shareable, well-documented resource for future reference.
