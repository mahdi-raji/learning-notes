## Registers
- The smallest and fastest storage units in a computer.
- Store data in bits.
- Can be accessed very quickly by the CPU.

## Cache
- Slower than registers.
- Larger in size than registers.
- Faster than main memory (RAM).

## Main Memory
- Also known as RAM (Random Access Memory).
- Anything that we load on the computer gets loaded into the main memory.
- Main memory is fast but limited and small in size.
- We cannot store all programs in memory, so we use secondary memory. When a program needs to be executed, it is loaded into the main memory.

> Analogy: Books are stored on a bookshelf (secondary memory), and we read them on a table (main memory). A bigger table (more RAM) allows more books to be read at once. Loading books from the shelf takes more time than reading them on the table.

## Secondary Storage Devices
- Include electronic, magnetic, and optical disks, as well as magnetic tapes.
- Slower than main memory but used for long-term data storage.
