- When hardware (like a keyboard, mouse, network card, etc.) triggers the CPU to stop its current execution and respond to a new event, it is called a hardware interrupt.
-  Example: You press a key on the keyboard — the hardware sends an interrupt to the CPU.
When software triggers an interrupt intentionally (usually to request a service from the operating system), it's called a software interrupt.
-  One common form of software interrupt is a system call.
