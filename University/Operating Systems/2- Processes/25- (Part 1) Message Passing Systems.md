- for example: the proccesses that want to communicate they lay within the same system. then this is easy for them to create a share region of memory and they can communicate with that but in distributed envs for example internet chat, still two processes have to communicate with each other in this scenario message passing systems can be used.

- a mesage passing facility provides at least two operations of send and receive message.
- message send by a process can be of either fixed or variable size :
- FIXED SIZE
- VARIABLE SIZE

- if you are going to implement a fixed size system, system level implementation is easy but in programing you have to always check for the size of the message to send it. but for varialbe size its برعکس

a communication link must be exist between communication P an d Q to send message and recieve message from each other.
