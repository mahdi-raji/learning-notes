Imagine you're in a coffee shop:

- The **Job Queue** is like a list of all the orders customers have placed — some are fully ready, some are waiting for milk, and some haven't even been reviewed yet.
    
- The **Ready Queue** is the set of orders that are completely ready to be prepared — they’re just waiting for a barista to pick them up and start working on them.
