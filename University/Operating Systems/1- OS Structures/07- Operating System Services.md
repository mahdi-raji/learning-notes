## User interface
Something that allows the user to interact with the OS or computer.

- ## CLI (Command Line Interface)
	- Provides a text-based way to interact with the system.
- ## GUI (Graphical User Interface)
	- Uses menus and other graphical elements for interaction.

## Program Execution

- The system must be able to load and run programs.

## I/O Operations

- A user cannot directly control input and output devices; the OS acts as an intermediary between the user and the devices.

## File System Manipulation
- Files are used to store data, and the OS manages how these files are accessed, manipulated, and organized.

## Communications
- Communication between processes.
- This can happen within the same computer or over a network.

## Error Detection
- Errors can occur in any part of the OS.
	- For example, if a printer runs out of paper, it generates an error. The OS must detect and handle such errors to ensure reliable and consistent computing (similar to a try-catch mechanism).

## Resource Allocation
- Allocating resources to different processes or users.
- Resources can be of various types such as main memory, I/O devices, etc.
- The OS must allocate resources efficiently.

## Accounting
- Keeping track of how much and what type of resources each user consumes.
- This record can be used for billing or simply to gather usage statistics.

# Protection and Security
- Our data and actions must be secured.
- Processes should not interfere with each other's operations.
- This involves controlling all access to system resources.
- We must ensure that the system is protected from unauthorized access.
- **A chain is only as strong as its weakest link:**
	- Even if your system is mostly secure, its overall security depends on the weakest part.
	- If you protect everything except one weak point, that point can make the entire system vulnerable.
